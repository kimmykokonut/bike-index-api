When you create your template repository, take the time to add thorough installation/setup instructions to your README. This should include information on how to run the project:

Installing all packages with $ npm install.

Building the project using webpack with $ npm run build

Starting a development server with $ npm run start

Linting JS files in the src folder with $ npm run lint

Running tests with Jest using $ npm run test

Also, make sure you update the Technologies Used section of your README, too! There's been a host of new tech that we've used in our projects in this course section.
